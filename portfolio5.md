As for the lesson side, I think it was a good experience because the project taught me to be consistent in my work, giving me clear objectives and respecting them. I also learned some technologies such as Django, deepened HTML CSS JAVASCRIPT AND PYTHON technologies. The project overall went very well, I didn't have any extreme problems
